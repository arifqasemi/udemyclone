the most complex project i have ever build. i am still working on. it is not completed yet

1. i built a PHP MVC framework from scratch
2. i used a prebuild theme and customize it for the fronted and admin dashboard
3. i have connected the database
4. i wrote the CRUD queries like insert, delete, update, where, and findAll
5. i created a form for adding course and table for showing all the courses
6. and most complicated part was edit course because there i have to make it work when a user add many section for a course and every section has many lectures and every lectures video and title
